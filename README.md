Objective: To create a script to check the integrity of a string or file by computing the hash code for SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512, SHA-3(256) and SHA-3(512). <br />
Developed using Python version 2.7 on Windows 10 <br />
Hashlib patched to support SHA-3 using the pysha3-0.3.win32-py2.7.exe installer located at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pysha3/ <br />
